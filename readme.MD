## My website
This repository contains the UI template as well as the static site generator integration for my personal website. Currently exploring few different tools in Python to generate the site.

#### UI Template
    UI folder contains the static website, pure front end of this website. This template can be used to integrate with other static site generator if you need it. 

    cd ./ui
    npm install
    npm start

    above commands would kick start a webpack dev server where you can see the UI template in action on http://localhost:8080
